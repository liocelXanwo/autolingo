Shabar Mantra is not only effective for materialistic gains, but also for spiritual growth and enlightenment. According to Lord Shiva, Shabar Mantra can help destroying lust and anger and can help entice minds. It can assist the mind in removing itself from low enjoyments and can encourage a deep sense of craving for Moksha or liberation[^4^]. There is a prescribed method of chanting Shabar Mantra that involves concentration, devotion, and faith.
 
Shabar Mantra can also protect you from the negative effects of black magic, evil eye, curses, and enemies. It can create a shield of positive energy around you that repels any harm or danger. It can also heal you from physical and mental ailments, such as fever, pain, stress, anxiety, depression, etc. Shabar Mantra can also help you gain control over your own mind and emotions, as well as influence the minds of others[^3^]. It can make you more charismatic, persuasive, and confident.
 
Shabar Mantra is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals and dreams. However, you should not misuse it for selfish or harmful purposes. You should always respect the deity of the mantra and follow the ethical and moral principles of life. You should also be grateful for the blessings you receive and share them with others. Shabar Mantra is a gift from Lord Shiva and Guru Gorakhnath to humanity, and you should use it wisely and responsibly.
