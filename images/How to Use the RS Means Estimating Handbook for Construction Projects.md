# How to Use the RS Means Estimating Handbook for Construction Projects
 
The RS Means Estimating Handbook is a comprehensive reference that covers the full spectrum of technical data required to estimate costs for major construction projects. It is widely used in the industry for tasks ranging from routine estimates to special cost analysis projects. It has been completely updated and reorganized with new and expanded technical information, including construction specialties, preliminary or square foot estimating tools, city cost indexes, historic indexes, and the newest CSI MasterFormat classification system[^5^] [^6^].

In this article, we will explain how to use the RS Means Estimating Handbook to evaluate architectural plans and specifications, prepare accurate quantity takeoffs, compare design alternatives and costs, perform value engineering, double-check estimates and quotes, and estimate change orders. By following these steps, you will be able to produce reliable and realistic cost estimates for your construction projects.
 
## Evaluate architectural plans and specifications
 
The first step in using the RS Means Estimating Handbook is to evaluate the architectural plans and specifications of the project. This will help you identify the scope, quality, and complexity of the work involved. You will also be able to spot any errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the documents that may affect the cost estimate.
 
To evaluate the architectural plans and specifications, you will need to review the following elements:
 
- The drawings, including floor plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules, and diagrams.
- The specifications, including general conditions, special conditions, technical specifications, and addenda.
- The contract documents, including bid forms, bid bonds, performance bonds, insurance requirements, and payment terms.

You will need to check for the following aspects:

- The completeness and accuracy of the information provided.
- The clarity and consistency of the terminology used.
- The compliance with codes, standards, regulations, and best practices.
- The feasibility and constructability of the design solutions proposed.
- The availability and suitability of the materials and equipment specified.
- The coordination and integration of the different disciplines involved.

If you find any discrepancies or ambiguities in the architectural plans and specifications, you should contact the architect or engineer for clarification or correction before proceeding with the cost estimate.
 
## Prepare accurate quantity takeoffs
 
The second step in using the RS Means Estimating Handbook is to prepare accurate quantity takeoffs for each item of work required by the project. This will help you determine the amount of materials, labor, equipment, and subcontractors needed to complete the project. You will also be able to calculate the unit costs and total costs for each item of work.
 
To prepare accurate quantity takeoffs, you will need to use the following tools:

- The RS Means Estimating Handbook itself, which provides detailed descriptions, illustrations, tables, 0f148eb4a0
