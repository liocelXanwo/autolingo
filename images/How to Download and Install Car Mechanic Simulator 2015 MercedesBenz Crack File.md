However, if you don't want to buy the game from Steam or other platforms, you might be looking for a way to download and install a crack file that allows you to play the game for free. This is not a legal or safe method, and we do not recommend it. But if you still want to try it, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download the crack file from a reliable source, such as MegaGames[^2^]. Make sure you have an antivirus software installed and scan the file before opening it.
2. Extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder named "CODEX" with several files inside.
3. Copy all the files from the "CODEX" folder and paste them into the folder where you installed Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. This will overwrite some of the original files, so make sure you have a backup in case something goes wrong.
4. Run the game from the "cms2015.exe" file. You should be able to play Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 - Mercedes-Benz without any problems.

Note that this method might not work for future updates or patches of the game, and it might cause some errors or bugs. Also, you might face legal consequences if you are caught using a cracked version of the game. Therefore, we advise you to purchase the game legally from Steam or other platforms and support the developers.
